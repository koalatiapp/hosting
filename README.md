# Self-hosting template for Koalati

Want to spin up your own instance of [Koalati](https://www.koalati.com) 
internally on your own server?

This repository contains everything you need to get started.

To learn more about Koalati's hosted service versus self-hosting, check out 
our [Self-Hosting](https://www.koalati.com/self-hosting) page.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koalatiapp/hosting.git koalati
   ```
2. Move into the newly created `koalati` directory:
   ```bash
   cd koalati
   ```
3. Run the initialization script and follow instructions:
   ```bash
   bash initialize-environment.sh
   ```
4. Start the server via `docker-compose`:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

Once the server is up, you should be able to start using Koalati!
Open [`https://localhost`](https://localhost) in your browser (or whichever 
other hostname you configured), and your own instance of Koalati should be up
and running.

If you run into SSL certificate issues in your browser, check out the [Troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting)
for an easy fix.

However, there's one last thing you should know about: self-hosted instances of 
Koalati are in [invitation-only mode](https://github.com/koalatiapp/app/blob/master/docs/system/self-hosting.md#invitation-only-mode) 
by default. 

This means visitors cannot sign up unless they have been invited by an existing 
user.

To create that first user, use the `create-user` command:

```bash
docker-compose exec php bin/console app:security:create-user
```

And voil√†!

## Updating your Koalati installation

Every once in a while, you'll want to update your self-hosted instance of 
Koalati to get the latest features, improvements and bugfixes.

To do that, first make sure your `KOALATI_VERSION` variable is set to `latest`
in the `.env` file.

Then, run the following commands to update:

```bash
docker-compose down --remove-orphans
docker-compose pull php
docker-compose pull caddy
docker-compose pull tools-service
docker-compose up -d
```

## Self-hosting specific changes

To learn about self-hosting specific changes, check out our [self-hosting documentation](https://github.com/koalatiapp/app/blob/master/docs/system/self-hosting.md#invitation-only-mode) 
on Koalati's main repository.

## Security

- Invitation-only mode is enabled by default.
  - This is done as a security measure to prevent people discovering your 
    internal Koalati instance and abusing it. 
  - If your internal Koalati instance is protected via some other security 
    measure (VPN, .htpasswd, etc.), you may disable this mode.

## Troubleshooting
### Untrusted SSL certificate issues

If you have a TLS trust issues, you can copy the self-signed certificate from Caddy and add it to the trusted certificates:

#### Mac
```bash
docker cp $(docker compose ps -q caddy):/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt /tmp/root.crt && sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /tmp/root.crt
```

#### Linux
```bash
docker cp $(docker compose ps -q caddy):/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/root.crt && sudo update-ca-certificates
```

#### Windows
```bash
docker compose cp caddy:/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt %TEMP%/root.crt && certutil -addstore -f "ROOT" %TEMP%/root.crt
```
